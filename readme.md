# EATHEALTHY
## My first project

## Why did I create it?

I created this project to learn PHP.

## What is Eathealthy?

This is an advertising service, where people can sell and buy their own local farm products such as vegetables and fruits. 

The project is based on MVC design pattern. It uses PHP v8.01 for back end and Bootstrap v4.6.x for responsive front end.

All data is store in connected MySQL database, implemented with CRUD approach.

At the moment Eathealthy supports:

- browsing added advertisements with search filters
- login/register system
- user panel with options:
  - adding, editing and deleting advertisements
  - adding, editing user data
  - changing password 
  - deleting account
